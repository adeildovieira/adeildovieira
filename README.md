# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I am a junior at Duke University studying Computer Science, with a likely concentration in AI/Machine Learning. <br>I am currently interested in Software Engineering, working on projects for good, and merging all those interests in internship positions. I am the first of my family to attend University, and my distinctive journey from rural Brazil to Duke fuels my mission to leverage technology in bridging global opportunities.

Recent achievements include:
- Selected as 1 of 18 students nationwide for Microsoft's NYC Summer Mentorship Program (Microsoft Copilot Studio & Azure)
- As a Software Engineer Intern, engineered a predictive occupancy using Machine Learning (Data preprocessing, Random Forest & Linear Regression, fine tuning), IoT CO2 sensor, and REST web service, also managing stakeholder relations
- Selected as a student representing the Duke Dept. of Computer Science to attend fully covered the SHPE National Convention 2024

Currently, exploring Software Engineering opportunities where I can apply my technical skills and global mindset to develop innovative solutions. I'm particularly passionate about projects that combine technical excellence with social impact.
